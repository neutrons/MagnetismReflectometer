Developer Documentation
=======================

Directory Tree
--------------
 - Code under `mr_reduction/` is common reduction code.
 - Code under `mr_autoreduce/` is the top-level code used by the post-processing.
 - Code under `mr_livereduce/` is the top-level code for live reduction.

Local Environment
-----------------
For purposes of development, create conda environment `mr_reduction` with file `environment.yml`, and then
install the package in development mode with `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd /path/to/mr_reduction/
   $> conda create env --solver libmamba --file ./environment.yml
   $> conda activate mr_reduction
   (mr_reduction)$> pip install -e ./

By installing the package in development mode, one doesn't need to re-install package `usanred` in conda
environment `mr_reduction` after every change to the source code.

pre-commit Hooks
----------------

Activate the hooks by typing in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd cd /path/to/mr_reduction/
   $> conda activate mr_reduction
   (mr_reduction)$> pre-commit install

Development procedure
---------------------

1. A developer is assigned with a task during neutron status meeting and changes the task's status to **In Progress**.
2. The developer creates a branch off *next* and completes the task in this branch.
3. The developer creates a pull request (PR) off *next*.
4. Any new features or bugfixes must be covered by new and/or refactored automated tests.
5. The developer asks for another developer as a reviewer to review the PR.
   A PR can only be approved and merged by the reviewer.
6. The developer changes the taskâ€™s status to **Complete** and closes the associated issue.

Using the Data Repository mr_reduction-data
-------------------------------------------
To some of the tests in your local environment, it is necessary first to download the data files.
Because of their size, the files are stored in the Git LFS repository
`mr_reduction-data <https://code.ornl.gov/sns-hfir-scse/infrastructure/test-data/mr_reduction-data>`_.

It is necessary to have package `git-lfs` installed in your machine.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> sudo apt install git-lfs

After this step, initialize or update the data repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd /path/to/usanred
   $> git submodule update --init

This will either clone `mr_reduction-data` into `/path/to/usanred/tests/mr_reduction-data` or
bring the `mr_reduction-data`'s refspec in sync with the refspec listed within file `/path/to/mr_reduction/.gitmodules`.

An intro to Git LFS in the context of the Neutron Data Project is found in the
`Confluence pages <https://ornl-neutrons.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDPD/pages/19103745/Using+git-lfs+for+test+data>`_
(login required).

Running tests
-------------
After activating your conda environment for development, one can run three types of tests with `pytest`:

- tests that do not require any input data files
- tests requiring input data files from the data repository
- tests requiring input data files from the /SNS and /HFIR file systems

.. code-block:: bash

   $> python -m pytest -vv -m "not datarepo and not sns_mounted" tests/
   $> python -m pytest -vv -m "datarepo" tests/
   $> python -m pytest -vv -m "sns_mounted" tests/


Coverage reports
----------------

GitHuh actions create reports for unit and integration tests, then combine into one report and upload it to
`Codecov <https://app.codecov.io/gh/neutrons/mr_reduction>`_.


Building the documentation
--------------------------
A repository webhook is setup to automatically trigger the latest documentation build by GitHub actions.
To manually build the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> conda activate mr_reduction
   (mr_reduction)$> cd /path/to/mr_reduction/docs
   (mr_reduction)$> make docs

After this, point your browser to
`file:///path/to/mr_reduction/docs/build/html/index.html`


Updating mantid dependency
--------------------------
The mantid version and the mantid conda channel (`mantid/label/main` or `mantid/label/nightly`) **must** be
synchronized across these files:

- environment.yml
- conda.recipe/meta.yml
- .github/workflows/package.yml
- .github/workflows/unittest.yml

Creating a stable release
-------------------------
- Follow the `Software Maturity Model <https://ornl-neutrons.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDPD/pages/23363585/Software+Maturity+Model>`_
  for continuous versioning, as well as creating Candidate and Production releases.
- Update the :ref:`Release Notes <release_notes>` with major fixes, updates and additions since last stable release.
